## Code Crossword Vocabulary Exercise

### Description

A custom crosswords application dedicated to vocabulary relevant to the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

### Intro

There's a ton of new vernacular to learn when learning to code.  Vocabulary exercises can help.  This is such an exercise, with a focus on the curriculum of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

### Instructions

Go [here](http://gitrobertpm.github.io/fsjs-crosswords/) to play the crosswords live.

To play with locally, download or clone repo, and simply load the index.html file in your preferred browser, which hopefully is Chrome, or else you may be beyond help and hope. :joy:

To customize puzzle, add new objects to the js/puzzles.js file, following the exampled schema.  All puzzle objects added there should automatically be added to the select element options, and choosing the new puzzle should automatically create the puzzle and its functionality and add it to the display.  If the code is not able to generate a puzzle based on the answer and clues you've provided, then a puzzle won't show up on the page when selected from the drop down menu, and a complicated error will be thrown in the console. Workaround is to try rearaning your answer: clue pairs in the object, and adding or removing some pairs to find a combination that works with this program.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
